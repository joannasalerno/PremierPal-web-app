# PremierPal-web-app

This is a web application called PremierPal, which allows fans of the English Premier League to view various statistics and information related to the teams and top players of the league. Users can also browse the nearest bars and pubs to each team's home venue to livestream matches and immerse themselves in the lively and fun match day atmosphere.

This application consists of two separate applications, a client React application and a server Express application. You will need to ensure that both are running for the application to work.

How to Run:
In both project directories (client and server), you will first need to run:

npm install
This will install the required dependencies for the project (in a folder called node_modules). Then, you will need to run:

npm start
This should open the client project in a browser window. If a browser window does not automatically open, go to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.
This should open the server project as well, and you can check that the server is up by going to http://localhost:3001. You should see "PremierPal server" listed on the page, and if so, the server is up and running.
